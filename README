Barrier implementation based on a Reader/Writer Lock, a mutex and a counter.

Unfortunately this package actually predates the lovely "go" tool and the repository isn't
well named.  The package is called "barrrier" but you can import it by:

import (
	"github.com/Leimy/Go-Barrier"
)

Then use it as "barrer.NewGroup(<size>)" etc.

I could probably fork it on github to fix that, but I'm not sure it's worth it as I'm the
only one using this to the best of my knowledge.
